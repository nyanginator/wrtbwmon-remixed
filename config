# Unit of data storage. Only "KB" or "MB" are valid. This determines the maximum
# value for any single number: 2 TB for KB, 2 PB for MB. If you expect high usage,
# use MB. When a number exceeds (2^31 - 1) = 2147483647, integer overflow occurs,
# resulting in a nonsensical negative number. Note that changing the value here
# does not update previously saved number values.

# In MB, when users on the watch list are within 2 increments of this value,
# they will appear on the list
WATCHLISTSTEP="1000"

# You can set a limit per person (in MB) in every "watch list" defined below.
# Each watch list should include variables for: quota per person, title, and
# array of names to watch. The name array should consist of unique 1-word names
# separated by spaces. For example:
# 
#   WATCHLISTARRAY="Calvin Phoebe Justin"
# 
# The user Calvin might have devices named (in users.txt) "Calvin's Phone",
# "Calvin's iPad", and "Calvin's Laptop". All 3 devices would count towards
# Calvin's quota.
#
# NOTES:
#   a. If you add a new watch list (in addition to the STUDENT and GUEST lists
#      below), the wrtbwmon script must also be updated. You'd need to add
#      another line of publishWatchList() with the vars you define below.
#   b. Prepend "SKIP_" to the name if you want the name to appear in the watch
#      list but not be turned off when over the specified limit. "SKIP_" would
#      also restore any suspended connections for that name.
